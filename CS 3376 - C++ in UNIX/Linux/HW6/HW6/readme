BEFORE ANYTHING MAX THE SIZE OF PUTTY OR WHATEVER YOU'RE USING! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

1) Determine which of the following sound good:
a - run the executable goto 2
b - make. goto 3

2) execute the executable. Wait a while for it to start. It can take a while.

3) Make: change " -L ~/Linux/lib " to point to your CDK stashed lib. run make. run make clean. run it. Wait a while for it to start. It can take a while.

4) So you wanna quit? ^C. Wait for it to empty out of everything.
